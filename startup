The peripherals don't seem to be listened ordered, I want to check out what the order is
but have no idea what so ever how to get the names back from the wrapped peripherals

Oh, I also want to reorder them so that they go from bioreactor_0>15

This will be useful later for when I'm doing the animated GUI]]
